Hello! Would you like some help?
    + [Yes, please!]
        Splendid! Here’s what you need to know, little witch:
        Shiny pearls are hidden all around this cavern. There are ten in total—count carefully now!
        Feed the pearls to that creature over there. Don’t be shy, press *F* when you’re close.
        When its tummy is full, it might just have a magical surprise for you. Double jumps are quite... *uplifting!*
        Oh, and the exit door? High, high, high up on the far right. You’ll need that little extra *bounce* to reach it.
        That's all for now, good luck little witch!
        
        
        -> DONE
    + [No, thank you.]
        Okay, Press Space To Continue.
